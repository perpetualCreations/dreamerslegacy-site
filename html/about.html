                    <p>Project portfolio, mainly consisting of technical projects.</p>
                    <p>At this point, the site has been running for 2 years now, across multiple iterations, the current iteration salvaged from previous versions.</p>
                    <p>The source for this portfolio is available <a href = "https://github.com/perpetualCreations/dreamerslegacy-site" target = "_blank">here.</a> The old repository was privated, before being closed it had around 60 commits across multiple years.</p>

                    <p>This site was previously hosted on Dreamhost's Glendale shared hosting servers.</p>
                    <p>It has now moved to my own local server, and previously registered to a FreeDNS subdomain (ateliertrefoil.undo.it).</p>
                    <p>I've since moved to a full-fledged domain (dreamerslegacy.xyz). Despite no longer relying on FreeDNS, I still recommend their service for any of your needs. You can visit them at <a href = "https://freedns.afraid.org/" target = "_blank">freedns.afraid.org.</a></p>
