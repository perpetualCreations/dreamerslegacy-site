# Competitive Shenanigans

## Introduction
Imagine you're working on your latest, most-useless, unprofessional, slow, and poorly-written project, filled to the brim with procrastination and suffering.

Your ma waltzes through the door, phone in hand, "X! There's a competitive coding conference at 7 PM!"

You briefly cringe at the usage of non-military time, intellectuals would refer to this term as 1900 hours, of course. Intellectuals yourself are also too stubborn to use customary units.
Metric superiority, for avoiding unit conversions that result in irrational sequences. Oh and also because half the world uses it. Except island countries and the U.S apparently.
Also you use Kelvin as your standard measurement of temperature- alright this joke is no longer funny.

You try to persuade her: you're not interested in competitive programming, afterall, you're a high-level programmer who relies on API references and half the time has to refer to StackOverflow.
The thought makes you shiver: low-level programming, bare-metal, C++, you chickened out after the sheer number of operators used in the language. And having to write built-in functions yourself, or depend on libraries from 2007.

But of course, she tells you to attend anyways. You decide on not complaining further, at least if you fail college admissions just like how you failed before, 
"not attending coding-related conferences" will not be on the list of reasons you have sank further down the pit of normalcy.

Jesus, you're miserable.

Anyways the guy hosting the conference is awkward as all-heck-in-the-world and you often find yourself staring at the wall wondering what they're saying, because your ma never told you it was in Mandarin.
What's that? A Chinese guy who is illiterate in their "native" language? Preposterous, I know. 
But turns out growing up in a place where most of the time you use English and using foreign languages is either frowned upon or worthy of mockery isn't very good for the art of bilingual communication. 

The first section of the poorly-worded **Microsoft Office PowerPoint (TM)** presentation written in Engrish details why student should get into programming. 
Obviously, you already know why, afterall you've been stuck in this bottom-less pit for 3 years. The carrot was always dangling in front of you.

The next part is about learning to program.
For someone who bodged their way into JavaScript, you have decent knowledge of resources to defer to when deliberating in need of knowledge. Your favorite sites to reference are Google, Google, and Google.
Did I mention Google? Google.

And then the presenter with his sweat pores fully in view of the less-than-picturesque conference camera feed, enters the section about resources for code training.

And you've heard of them before: HackerRank and Leetcode. You hate both of them with a passion because it seems everyone on those platforms are either elitist snobs, 
degenerates who think their capacity for copying other people's answers is proportional to the size of their genitalia, and innocent clueless people who are in Uni and just want a leg-up.
Actually the Uni people are mostly okay. But you still hate everyone else.

But perhaps you thought, perhaps. Ever since you were a small child, yes, even smaller than you are now, you scrawny five-foot-tall floppy-arm nerd, you were self-taught.
No teacher gave you instructions, until three weeks ago when your physics teacher gave you a half decent explanation of something. You don't remember what because you were busy Googling formulas and theories.
You learned the entirety of intermediate Python programming alone, through extremely poorly-thought-out projects, online tutorials, outdated textbooks, and "cancerous video tutorials on Youtube.com" which you will never speak of again.
"Having a microphone that is the afterbirth of a screaming child and a tornado siren" should be on the UN sancations against torture, right below group projects and waterboarding.

"I should try it. It'll be a bit of confirmation against Imposter syndrome."

Which was true, nobody ever looked at your work and was impressed by it. Not because your work was objectively awful, but because you never showed it to anyone in the first place.
Teachers saw glimpses of your machinations while you were in school, after finishing the classwork 10 minutes into the class period and having nothing better to do.
They of course, never comprehended what you were doing. Nobody minded, except your biology teacher in 7th grade who thought you were breaching the school's IT network.
Your cousin who your parents set as the perfect example of someone who suffered a failure and managed to set themselves straight again was mildly impressed that a 13-year-old threw together what was basically an RC-car, and the result wasn't an abomination.
Of course you couldn't really tell if he was genuine or not. To be fair, pre-COVID a friend dropped by your house unannounced for some reason, and admired the skeleton of that project, and noted the rat's nest of wires looked like a bomb. You wanted to dispute that with him but he wasn't wrong.

A dive into those platforms might not be that bad. You'll just avoid the community discussions tab to avoid mental degradation and atrophy.
The rest of the presentation wasn't particularly interesting either. You already knew what ACSL and USACO were, you tried USACO before and ACSL was more rigorous with registration. 
Also the latter required teams of people. Something something, we're programmers, something something, we don't like social interaction. 
In effect, it's a group project, but everybody contributes, just with varying degrees of effectiveness, and a very not productive discussion afterwards.

Not thinking too much of it, you go to sleep 6 hours later at 1 AM, after caving and playing a game for the rest of the night.

## No Idea

### Story
You wake up the next day. You, in a very edgy and emo manner, remark to yourself that you didn't die in your sleep.
Sharp objects materialize as the essence of your edgy statement seeps into the surrounding environment.
Luckily nobody was nearby to suffer the effects of the cringe-field that manifested when that remark was made, however your room and gut is now sterile as all immediate microbials in the surrounding area died as a result of your cringe-field.

Normally you start the day with procrastination, and then continue procrastinating until 3 PM when you realize you wasted half the day. 
But today you feel **motivated**. The power of **motivation** infuses itself into your soul, and you collapse back into bed for another hour of sleep.

You remember, yesterday evening you were watching a conference about competitive programming. 
Yes, indeed, you should try it as a warmup excersie. You already registered for HackerRank yesterday, and just left the browser tab open.
You ~~put your programmer socks and crop top on~~ walk around the house looking for where you left your non-prescription glasses that are definitely for your eyesight and not to keep your hair out of your eyes.

After finding them ~~at the south pole and then Toronto, Canada, with a layover in Switzerland~~ somewhere you don't recall passing through last night, 
you put on your space-defying anomalous eyeware that will probably warrant the SCP Foundation to raid your residency.

After some deliberation, you randomly pick a coding challenge.

### Problem
The problem's name is No-Idea. You try reading the prompt but its filled with technical jargon and math symbols that you can't copy and paste into a search engine to lookup their meaning.
It is a "medium difficulty' problem.

After analyzing the problem in-depth, and with one reference to a Wikipedia glossary on every common math symbol, the problem asks:

- You have two integer sets, A and B.
- You have a integer variable, X.
- You have a third integer set, N.

With these values:

- If A exists in N, add 1 to X. 
- If B exists in N, subtract 1 from X.
- Sets A and B have duplicate elements, elements should only be used once.

And the criteria for completion is:

- You must return X after checking values in A and B and completing their respective operators for each element in sets A and B.
- Values will be piped in through STDIN and the result piped out with STDOUT. Use PRINT and INPUT. 
- You must process sets A and B within the time limit (which is about 15 seconds or so).

After headdesking for a moment, over needless terminology such as, "disjoint sets" and "for each i integer in array" with usage of the set membership symbol, you realize this was a lot easier than the prompt was making it out to be.

### Solution
Your first attempt ended with a RuntimeError, because you forgot to add parenthesis symbols to the input function call. After correcting your careless mistake, you try again. 

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

input() # discard the first line, if i really wanted A and B set lengths, len() exists
valid: list = input().split(" ")
these_make_me_happy: list = input.split(" ")
these_make_me_depressed: list = input.split(" ")
happiness: int = 0

for x in these_make_me_happy:
    if x in valid: happiness += 1

for x in these_make_me_depressed:
    if x in valid: happiness -= 1
    
print(happiness)
```

The subsequent attempts ended with 3 of the 10 test cases passing, and all of the test cases are hidden from you for some reason.

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

input() # discard the first line, if i really wanted A and B set lengths, len() exists
valid: list = input().split(" ")
these_make_me_happy: list = input().split(" ")
these_make_me_depressed: list = input().split(" ")
happiness: int = 0

for x in these_make_me_happy:
    if x in valid: happiness += 1

for x in these_make_me_depressed:
    if x in valid: happiness -= 1
    
print(happiness)
```

You then think to check for duplicate elements.

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

input() # discard the first line, if i really wanted A and B set lengths, len() exists
valid: list = input().split(" ")
these_make_me_happy: list = input().split(" ")
these_make_me_happy_parsed = [] # prevents duplicates
these_make_me_depressed: list = input().split(" ")
these_make_me_depressed_parsed = [] # prevents duplicates
happiness: int = 0

for x in these_make_me_happy:
    if x in valid and x not in these_make_me_happy_parsed: 
        happiness += 1
        these_make_me_happy_parsed.append(x)    
        
for x in these_make_me_depressed:
    if x in valid and x not in these_make_me_depressed_parsed: 
        happiness -= 1
        these_make_me_depressed_parsed.append(x)
        
print(happiness)
```

Same result. After some deliberation you come across the SET function. This orders element lists and removes repeating values, making your primitive list duplicate checking no longer required. 

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

input() # discard the first line, if i really wanted A and B set lengths, len() exists
valid: list = input().split()
these_make_me_happy: list = set(input().split())
these_make_me_depressed: list = set(input().split())
happiness: int = 0

for x in these_make_me_happy:
    if x in valid: 
        happiness += 1 
        
for x in these_make_me_depressed:
    if x in valid: 
        happiness -= 1
        
print(happiness)
```

No workie. Sad. You look at the error results: processing timed out. Now you're just confused, why timed-out? It's just a few number comparisons, it doesn't take that long to process.
You cave and use the website's currency awarded for logging in and completing challenges to view one of the 7 failing test cases and...

...It's literally a 1000 elements long, no wonder it's taking forever to index through elements. Code optimization time.

You move comparisons into one for-loop, that indexes through the N set, and sees if the N element exists in A and B instead, reducing processing time by half, since the program doesn't index through A and B individually, and also effectively skipping over values that aren't valid.

```python
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

input() # discard the first line, if i really wanted A and B set lengths, len() exists
valid: list = input().split()
these_make_me_happy: list = set(input().split())
these_make_me_depressed: list = set(input().split())
happiness: int = 0

for x in valid:
    if x in these_make_me_happy: happiness += 1
    if x in these_make_me_depressed: happiness -= 1
        
print(happiness)
```

Congrats. It worked. You completed your first challenge within 30 minutes.
