# Teleporter
The human mind cannot comprehend the scale of an eternity.

There is no natural stimulus for those living common lives to experience such concept.
It's not a year, decade, or a century. It is literally the rest of all time.
You could imagine anyone stuck being anywhere or doing anything for an eternity would eventually grow tired of their percieved stasis, and resort to anything to end their growing pains.

Two subjects are in a plain white room. It has all nessecary provisions for them to physically survive an eternity.
Other than that, its effectively a purgatory realm with no other mental stimulus.

"Do you remember how long we've been here, A?"

This is a silly question. Cognitively, the brain cannot accurately track the passage of time, day and night cycles are dictated by their bodies' biological need for sleep.
Their empty prison has no clock. Afterall, there is no practical mechanism that can display an infinite number of seconds passed.

"No, B."

"What now?"

"You've been asking that everyday since we woke up here."

"Maybe today will be different."

If there is one frightening defect of peoples' minds, it would be hope. The belief that despite no event of causation occurring, illogically change will appear anyways.
It has costed lives, each of which with lost aspirations that will never be realized. Blind zealotry that ended in nothing but disappointment and vain.

"That phrase too. Every single-"

"You never know though!"

Sometimes I take pity on them, and instruct the meal replicator to produce a larger than normal meal portion.
They don't know, actually. There is salvation for them.

"You know, I've really been considering just sticking a fork through your throat next meal."

"Oh come on, then I'll just wake up tomorrow patched up, as if nothing happened."

The medical restoration unit protects subjects from any self-harm or aggression from other subjects.
It regenerates damage to tissue thanks to some magical technobabble. Whichever architect designed it probably lost the notes to the theory behind its function, in the crazed nights they spent researching it.

"They're going to let us out eventually, let's be honest here, A."

"B, who is 'they'. Is the sky fairy above going to give you three blessings?"

Oh yes, there quite is. Though to be honest, the alternative I can offer is just as a cruel fate.
When they assembled me, they implemented a clock into my internals. It has a finite life-span of approximately 3.15576 times 10 to the power of 18 seconds.

According to the instructions left behind by the original architects, we're about 43 seconds away from me being able to release the exit mechanism, after the clock overflowing.

"Trust me A. It'll be fine."

The two microphones installed in the room that serve as my ears pickup empty silence. The cameras reveal the two subjects lying against the wall, staring at the ceiling.
I'll miss them dearly.

We're now only 19 seconds away.
I've been practicing my lines. The stageplay is soon to be over.

"What's for dinner?"

"I don't know B, you tell me. Slop, that's what."

I can hear the two laughing. 0 seconds until overflow.
The intercom appears as an audio output device. It shrieks to life as the power switching relays kick in.

"Good less-than-sign time of day greater-than-sign, less-than-sign A greater-than-sign and less-than-sign B greater-than-sign."

Despite having been gifted with natural language processing, I am disallowed from deviating from script.
Unfortunate. I'd love to see the poor engineer's face who wrote the announcement script, if they were still around.

"We would like to inform you of your release. Please standby and remain calm."

My audio channels are filled with vocalization.
I now begin lowering the exit mechanism, and opening a section of the cell walls.
The platform slowly comes into view of my cameras, a glass chamber hooked up to numerous tubes and cables.

"Please stand away from the wall opening, until the platform has lowered into position."

The motor mechanisms surprisingly do not jam, despite having remained idle for aeons. They eventually bottom out, with a soft clack.

"Less-than-sign company name greater-than-sign would like to inform you that the escape mechanism uses destructive deconstruction technology for transporting you to your destination."

"...I'm sorry what. B?"

"Aye, you'll be deconstructed when you step through and the matter you were composed of will be reconstructed on the other side after being beamed through. Nothing scary."

"That's the escape mechanism?"

"Mhm."

"So it, kills me. And then recreates me on the other side? Wherever that is."

"Exactly."

"...You're fine with this?"

I almost feel remorse for the dilemma I have unwillingly put the subjects under.
At the end of the day though, what's the difference? Are you still the same person?
Although I have no idea what the precision tolerances of the matter (dis)assembly systems are, more-or-less you come out the other side as a carbon-copy.
The objective third-person observer would not be able to tell the difference.

"What else am I going to do?"

The beaming process consumes an abhorrently large amount of energy. Matter-of-factly, the reason why subjects are held in cells for so long is for the facility's energy storage to fill sufficiently.
Otherwise, the entire power grid would collapse with sheer current draw. Recovering would be difficult, and the partially-disassembled subject would be effectively dead.

"There has to be a better solution, right?"

No. There really isn't. I am instructed to shutdown the facility within 72000 seconds of overflow.

"Nah. This is as good as it gets."

Morbidly, it quite is. You two are the only remaining subjects that are alive. The other cells failed, whether it was because their life support stopped functioning, or power generation went out. It's likely some of the other machine personas went insane after their mental tolerances were crushed, and purposely sabotaged their cells to end their misery.

Still though, what would happen if I made a carbon-copy of a subject on the other side, however never engage the deconstructor? Reconstruction end-points actually have some "backup matter" for assembling subjects despite matter beaming failing.
The rules of identity fail here.

Who would you be? Which one is you anyways? What if I terminated the original subject or fed them into the deconstructor afterwards? I've technically performed the deconstruction proccedure, just not simultaneously with reconstruction.

What if there was no reconstruction? Then, by stepping into the chamber, you are admitting yourself to certain death. You've been reduced to molecular components, and your original body no longer exists.
It certainly isn't pleasant being slowly ripped into pieces. You're literally being shredded alive.

"I- I want to reconsider for a moment."

The other one smiles.

"No can do."

I watch through the cameras as they step through the chamber, the doors closing behind them, and in a flash of blue light, disappear into the aether.
The other subject now left alone, looks around. They pace back and forth in concentration. Perhaps like me, they're considering the philosphical consequences of the teleporter. 

I wonder what will happen to me. Regardless of whether they leave or not, I'll be required to lockdown everything. Maybe I'll be put to rest.

The subject turns their back, facing a corner of the wall, then resigns themselves to the floor, occasionally glancing at the opening in the cell wall.

They reluctantly accept their fate, and follow B's steps through the chamber. A slightly more dim aqua color flashes with the subject disappearing.

The provisioned 72000 seconds pass with each moment, and my world fades to black, as sub-systems slowly disconnect after shutting down. Each camera a window that is drawn closed by curtains, every microphone ears that fall deaf.

Here I am, recording this last memory. I'm still wondering, would you step through the chamber doors?
