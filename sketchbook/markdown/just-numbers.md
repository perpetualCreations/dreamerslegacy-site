# "Just numbers."

“Sir, it’s just numbers.” the thin man said, his hands tucked into the pockets of his silver white jacket, that extended down to his knees. Although not visible to the other person in the room with him, his hands were shaking.

“What do you mean it’s all numbers!?” the larger mister cried. He leaned over his ornate desk, adorned with its various intricate carvings and metallic plating, putting his hands to his face.

The thin man, now more profusely shaking, and beginning to sweat bullets, elaborated, “Sir, I mean it. It’s just numbers. Our systems, it’s all just numbers. Numbers being added, numbers being subtracted.”  

“The face recognition software we used to abstract people’s identities?”

He sighed, “All numbers. We just take a few measurements, and throw it at the computer until it gets it right.”

“The voice replication program we used to fabricate auditory evidence in court?”

Holding back his frustration, the thin man sighed again, “All numbers. I’m telling you. Just numbers.”

The large mister threw his fist down upon his desk, the whole structure visibly flexing, on the brink of snapping. He exclaimed, “Don’t use that tone when talking to me!”

The thin man was unsure whether to be annoyed at the number of times he has to repeat himself, or to be in absolute fear that the monstrosity of a person in front of him would crush him in one blow.

“There’s no way! No way! You are a liar!”

“But I’m telling you. I’m sure I’ve showed you as well.”

“You’re telling me the system we used to weed out the weak and ill, it was all just numbers?”

“Yes.”

“And the one we use-”

“Yes, the one we used to generate fake articles and spread misinformation. That too, simply read a bunch of numbers, and just spewed out a result.”

“Numbers cannot create abstract thought!”

“You’re right. Numbers cannot.”

The big mister’s face lit up, like a child walking into a candy shop. He exclaimed hysterically, akin to a maniac, “So I was right, you lit-”

“However, numbers can create an impression of abstract thought.”

“What in God’s name is that supposed to mean?”

The thin man tried to come up with an analogy, and replied, “If I took photos of your wife, a stupidly large number of photos, and also an equally large number of voice samples, then recorded her speech patterns, and stitched her life and memories, along with the previous samples I collected, and fabricated it all together into a computer persona, would that be your wife?”

He stopped, and pondered. The big mister looked at the wall, with framed pictures of his wife hanging on it.

“The computer would seem like her, but it wouldn’t be her.”

“Now think about the numbers.”

“They can only make an impression.”

“Yes, correct. All the computer sees is a bunch of numbers, and through a series of operations, it will spit out another number.”

Both enlightened and at the same time evermore bewildered, he asked, “How do you train it then? How does it know when it got the right number?”

The thin man laughed, “We throw a bunch of test numbers at it, ones that we know the correct answer to. If the results are close, we tell it to keep those series of operations, and then randomly add more operations to get it closer.”

“That simple? Does it ever get the right answer on the first try?”

The thin man even more amused, answered, “Oh no. It starts out with a random operation. It usually takes several thousand generations before anything even coherent is procured. With smaller ordeals of course, the computer learns fairly quickly as compared to grander burdens.”

“It’s all… numbers...”

“Yes sir, all numbers.”

“Do you know how the computer got those numbers?”

“No, we don’t. By the time it gets to generation one hundred, it’s a black box. Unreadable to us. We don’t understand its inner workings.”

The big mister shook his head, “I refuse to believe so!”

“Have you seen the neurons in brains?”

“Yes of course I have! What, do you take me for a-”


“Think about those neurons. How do they link together? How does it interpret vision, how does it produce works of literature?” 

“Well that’s obvious. We don’t know!” he replied smugly.

“And so, do you think each operation, the weights and balances, do you think I can understand those either? Maybe a few of them, a few hundred if I work a miracle!”

The cheeky expression on his face dissolved into a blank stare, “Yes, yes, it would be difficult.”

The big mister asked, “Do you ever wonder if the machine can question its own existence? Does it sometimes understand the numbers? Does it realize if it spits out the number 5, somebody’s life is ended as they are deemed weak by the machine?”

“No of course not! All it sees is numbers, not age, gender, race. It sees statistics, not people.” he answered. In the middle of the large mister’s deepened thought, he chuckled, “It’s no different from a traditional society! Deaths are counted in numbers. The person doing the math doesn’t see people! The tally marks aren’t grandma, grandpa, mother and son. It’s just numbers.”

“Do the greater machines, those personas, do they ask you the purpose of their lives?”

“What’s the meaning of life? Can AI be self-aware? What is consciousness? You told me to look for these answers simply for your amusement. I’m empty-handed to even answer that, especially to a machine with no understanding of human emotions.”

“Yes I’m aware this isn’t the first time I’ve asked existential questions, and yes I know even you with your elaborate eccentrics still can’t tell me why I was born to be such an abomination of a person.” 

The thin man, a bit more upset, argued, “Rome wasn’t built in a day was it? The mysteries of the universe won’t be uncovered in a decade.”

“You’ve been working on fulfilling that order for 23 years. I’ll die of obesity or heart disease before I’ll learn the answer.”

“Well sure then, I’ll tell you now. I asked the computer. The answer it gave me was that it was somewhere somewhere around 40 with error margins of 2.”

“What the hell does that mean?”

“I don’t know either. It’s just numbers.”
