            <div id="content">
                <p>Command-line tool for automatically deleting files, webpages, and directories.</p>
                <p>Intended for Apache web server operators who want to host a temporary page or file that will deleted after a specified amount of time.</p>
                <h3>Install</h3>
                <p>deargodpleaseno is for Ubuntu systems, running Apache.</p>
                <p>For other Debian and Debian-based operating systems, please ignore package requirements when installing, and install your distribution's latest version of Apache.</p>
                <p>Install DGPN through APT, either from the dreamerslegacy.xyz PPA or from a Debian package if available under releases.</p>
                <p>Instructions for adding the package archive can be found <a href = "/index.html###ppa">on the main page</a>. For installing through the package archive, after adding it to your sources list,</p>
                <p class = "code-block">sudo<span class = "command"> apt update </span> &amp;&amp; sudo <span class = "command">apt install</span> deargodpleaseno</p>
                <p>For installing from a Debian package file, </p>
                <div class = "code-block">
                    <p>sudo <span class = "command">apt install</span> /path/to/package/file/deargodpleaseno_1.0_all.deb</p>
                </div>
                <p>To uninstall,</p>
                <p class = "code-block">sudo <span class = "command">dgpn</span> --uninstall</p>
                <p>Careful, this will remove the generated directory under the webroot, including any files and directories under the generated directory. See below this section for more details.</p>
                <p>Then fully remove the package.</p>
                <p class = "code-block">sudo <span class = "command">apt remove</span> deargodpleaseno</p>
                <h3>How to Use</h3>
                <p>Move a file or directory under the deargodpleaseno directory in the webroot.</p>
                <p>Open up your terminal, and run the command <span class = "code-quote">dgpn --help</span>. You'll be greeted with a list of valid parameters.</p>
                <p>This document will outline those parameters further, with given examples.</p>
                <h3><span class = "code-quote">--add</span></h3>
                <p>Specify a path after this parameter, for a directory or file that you wish to be added to the expiry queue.</p>
                <p>Use <span class = "code-quote">--bestbefore</span> in conjunction to specify an expiry time in hours. Without this parameter, the default expiry time will be assumed. The default time can be edited under <span class = "code-quote">/etc/deargodpleaseno/settings.cfg</span>, preconfigured to be 168 hours or a week.</p>
                <p>This example below will add <span class = "code-quote">/var/www/html/deargodpleaseno/temp.html</span> to the deletion queue with an expiry time of 24 hours.</p>
                <p class = "code-block">sudo <span class = "command">dgpn</span> --add /var/www/html/deargodpleaseno/temp.html --bestbefore 24</p>
                <h3><span class = "code-quote">--edit</span></h3>
                <p>Specify a path after this parameter, for a directory or file whose expiry time you wish to be edited. The file or directory must be added first.</p>
                <p>Requires <span class = "code-quote">--bestbefore</span> in conjunction to specify a new expiry time in hours. Without this parameter, the command will be invalid.</p>
                <p>This example below will change the expiry time of <span class = "code-quote">/var/www/html/deargodpleaseno/secret.zip</span> to 1 hour.</p>
                <p class = "code-block">sudo <span class = "command">dgpn</span> --edit /var/www/html/deargodpleaseno/secret.zip --bestbefore 1</p>
                <h3><span class = "code-quote">--remove</span></h3>
                <p>Specify a path after this parameter, for a directory or file that you wish to be removed from the deletion queue.</p>
                <p>Does not require any additional parameters. The item removed from queue will not be deleted.</p>
                <p>This example below will remove <span class = "code-quote">/var/www/html/deargodpleaseno/spice.png</span> from deletion queue.</p>
                <p class = "code-block">sudo <span class = "command">dgpn</span> --remove /var/www/html/deargodpleaseno/spice.png</p>
                <h3><span class = "code-quote">--uninstall</span></h3>
                <p>Specify this parameter to uninstall deargodpleaseno. Remove deargodpleaseno fully with your package manager.</p>
                <p>This will remove all entries from queue, and delete deargodpleaseno from the webroot. Be sure to preserve any items under the directory before running <span class = "code-quote">--uninstall</span>.</p>
                <p>An example is shown below.</p>
                <p class = "code-block">sudo <span class = "command">dgpn</span> --uninstall</p>
                <h3>Back-End</h3>
                <p>deargodpleaseno uses Linux's <span class = "code-quote">at</span>.</p>
                <p>It can be used to schedule commands in the future. The example below starts a package update in an hour.</p>
                <div class = "code-block">
                    <p>sudo at now + 1 hour</p>
                    <p>at> sudo <span class = "command">apt update</span> &amp;&amp; sudo <span class = "command">apt upgrade -y</span></p>
                    <p>at> &lt;EOT></p>
                </div>
                <p>deargodpleaseno can and probably will clog up your <span class = "code-quote">atq</span>. Exert caution when removing atjobs.</p>
                <p>To remember which atjobs are responsible for removing which items, an <span class = "code-quote">entries</span> files exists under <span class = "code-quote">/etc/deargodpleaseno/entries</span> which records items and their atjob number.</p>
                <p>They are formatted as <span class = "code-quote">0|||/var/www/html/deargodpleaseno/itemtobedeleted.html</span>, 0 before the 3 pipes being the atjob ID number, and path afterwards the item in question.</p>
                <p>If the entries and queue desync, reinstalling and clearing <span class = "code-quote">atq</span> with <span class = "code-quote">atrm</span> is the most efficient way of fixing it. Other options such as overwriting <span class = "code-quote">entries</span> are possible, but aren't foolproof.</p>
                <p>deargodpleaseno upon install will create its directory under the specified webroot. It will then append:</p>
                <div class = "code-block">
                    <p>User-agent: *</p>
                    <p>Disallow: /deargodpleaseno/</p>
                </div>
                <p>...To your <span class = "code-quote">robots.txt</span> file. This will prevent webcrawlers that obey user-agent rules from indexing the newly created directory.</p>
                <p>This of course isn't perfect, any webcrawlers that disregard user-agent rules or take several days or weeks to process new user-agent rules (looking at you SemRush bot) will render this ineffective.</p>
                <p>It will create this rule even if the file does not exist, you are recommended to review your user-agent rules post-installation. The same goes for post-uninstallation.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>This concludes our walkthrough of using the DGPN command and Debian package.</p>
                <h3>Future</h3>
                <p>Future features such as .htaccess control will be coming in following releases.</p>
                <p>More major changes are planned to no longer use <span class = "code-quote">at</span>, instead running an hourly <span class = "code-quote">crontab</span> to check for expired items on a list of entries. This would free up <span class = "code-quote">atq</span> for the user.</p>
                <h3>Misc.</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>The project icon is from a clip of Michael Gray Scott from the office, uttering the all-too-famous words, "No god please no!"</li>
                <li>The project name were the words that exited my mouth after an instructor gave a research project, where the end product could be a webpage.</li>
                <li>Not wanting to manually remove the page after the assignment was graded, this project was made.</li>
                <li>This was the first ever project I made to use Debian packaging as the distribution end-product.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>End</h3>
                <p>This is the end of the documentation for the DGPN command and package.</p>
