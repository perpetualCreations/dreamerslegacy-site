                <h3>1.1: Introduction</h3>
                <p>Raspbot is a small robotic vehicle, that is remotely operated via a local network, through a custom client application.</p>
                <p>The onboard computer is powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ running Raspbian. Additionally, it contains an Arduino microcontroller and an Arduino Motor Shield Rev3 (for controlling the dual tank treads).</p>

                <h3>1.3: Remote Control Application (RCA) </h3>
                <p>As mentioned, the robotic vehicle is operated via a client and host application. The client is GUI-based, the previous client was based on a command-line interface, the next releases of the control application will possibly make a return to CLI, for low-resource or specific scenarios where CLI is preferred. The host Raspbot RCA runs on Debian or Debian-based systems (i.e Ubuntu, Raspbian). The client is not OS-dependent.</p>
                <p>The application is written in Python, you may run it by installing Python 3 and the application's associated packages with PIP, please see requirements.txt files for package and version requirements. If using the SenseHAT as part of your hardware configuration, please install the PyPI package and also the Debian package. See hardware list for more details on SenseHAT and certain packages for particular hardware.</p>
                <p>Client binaries will be made available, however they are unsigned.</p>
                <p>It's recommended to use a designated user account on the Debian or Debian-based system, and to extract release contents to the user's home directory.</p>
                <p>In Raspbot RCA v1.1, credits to Pyimagesearch for the live camera view, please see /tkinter-photo-booth/tkinter-photo-booth-citation.txt for more information. Please note v1.2 and above this dependency has been removed.</p>
                <h3>1.4: Previous Revision</h3>
                <p>The previous hardware revision used a single-use 9V battery for supplying motor power, and used a commercial-off-the-shelf battery bank to power the Raspberry Pi. The chassis has since been redesigned, with more mounting space and wire pass-throughs.</p>
                <p>The control application client was updated from CLI to use Tkinter, and now the Qt GUI framework through PySide6. Since v1.1, the feature set and scope has gradually grown, and recently the Arduino code was updated for multi-character commands using a buffer.</p>
                <h3>2.1: Hardware List + Build Directions</h3>
                <p>Below is a list of hardware used, containg links to buy each of the hardware components, and also directions to assemble. Documentation and downloads can be found on each of the manufacturer's website. Note hardware sets have been revised over the project's development.</p>
                <p>The top case housing the electronics can be 3D printed, the CAD files are available in the project's download section.</p>
