# ARIA
## Revision 1.2, May 23rd, 2021
Request-oriented API language used by BRIAH-layer nodes.

[Back to Index](index.rst)

## 1.0, Motivation
BRIAH-layer applications, such as ARBITER and KINETIC, do not have a standard for communication.
Current protocols are nebulous and have no organized record. 
Additionally, they become problematic as new BRIAH applications are put into production, 
as they are not designed beyond the scope of their individual projects.

## 1.1, Abstract
ARIA is designed specifically for BRIAH-layer and applicable ASIYAH-layer applications. 

This document contains basic essentials of the ARIA protocol, and the API language for information exchange, 
with flexibility for specialized commands and arguments.

## 2.0, Protocol
ARIA is modeled after a server and client relationship, with one host serving as a server and another as a client.
Unlike a traditional server/client paradigm, the event structure is oriented where the server usually dispatches API commands to the client.

For all exchanges, when the server sends a command, the client replies with either "OK" or "KEYERROR"
where the first is sent upon a successful request, and the second when the command is unrecognized.
"KEYERROR" is not raised if the command was recognized, but was not able to be executed.

Upon a client connecting to a server, the server sends the "REQUEST TYPE" command. 
The client replies with the name of its application. The server checks if the client is a 
servicable application, and if not, promptly disconnects, ending the client manager's life-cycle.
If the server is servicable however, the connection is preserved and the client manager continues execution.

## 2.1, Extended Protocol
ARIA has an extended protocol for certain use cases and requirements for additional provisions. 

When applicable, servers may also dispatch a "REQUEST UUID" command after "REQUEST TYPE" is exchanged.
This is intended for servers identifying BRIAH applications with a UUID, usually resources, 
such as nodes linked to KINETIC agents, or fabrication equipment (namely 3D printers and other CNC machines).
Not all clients will respond to "REQUEST UUID" and some will fail completely.

Servers may dispatch a HELP command after "REQUEST TYPE" and "REQUEST UUID" to index valid commands ahead of time.
Commands before being sent may be reviewed, to see if they exist within the list of valid commands.

## 2.2, Modified Protocol
Implementations are not required to make use of all protocol components, with the exception of the "REQUEST TYPE" command, which is standard and required for all hosts.

## 2.3, API Reference
As long as the client supports it, commands are extendable. Custom commands defined
in the client's command lookup dictionary can be interpreted without issue,
when received from the server. 

Any NAVSCRIPT (see specification NAVSCRIPT) commands that are either local or not executed should not be used (i.e
GOTO and -#-).

### REQUEST
Has children,
- TYPE (Returns name of client application)
- UUID (Returns client UUID, if applicable)

Use in format,
REQUEST (CHILD ARGUMENT)
### OS
Optional, not supported by all hosts.
Has children,
- STOP (Stops host application)
- SHUTDOWN (Shuts down host operating system)
- REBOOT (Reboots host operating system)
- UPDATE (Updates host operating system

Use in format,
OS (CHILD ARGUMENT)

### ABORT
Aborts connection, server client manager disconnects and the client is left to sit idle or retry a server connection.

It's recommended to delay retries by an exponentially growing integer, per each retry attempt, to prevent spam and
resulting resource drainage.
### HELP
Optional, not supported by all hosts.
Reserved by client applications. Sends ALL valid commands in the lookup dictionary.

Excerpt from KINETIC source code,
```text
If dictionary key "HELP" does not exist in lookup, command is set to send all valid commands as individual TXs.
The transmission is initiated with the length of the command list (counting from 1).
For the controller to receive the command list, it should first receive the "OK" acknowledgement, and then the
second TX containing length, and start a for loop lasting the length of command list.
```
### UPDATE
Optional, not supported by all hosts.
Signals to change from normal request/response to request-less event-based one-way transmission.

Both hosts must be pre-programmed to have a contingency for UPDATE command support.
