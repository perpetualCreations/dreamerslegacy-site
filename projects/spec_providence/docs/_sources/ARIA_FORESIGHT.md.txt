# ARIA - FORESIGHT MOD.
## Revision 1.0, May 3rd, 2021
Modifications to ARIA protocol for FORESIGHT implementation.

[Back to Index](index.rst)

## 1.0, Motivation
FORESIGHT has a reversed, client-to-server dynamic. This by principle, violates ARIA's flow model.
With special considerations required, the standard could be consolidated into a separate modified variation.

## 1.1, Abstract
ARIA FORESIGHT changes the server/client communication dynamic, and includes a non-standard API.

## 2.0, Protocol
Standard protocol is preserved, however post-"REQUEST TYPE" exchange, the server listens for API requests from the client.

ARIA FORESIGHT has no exit protocol. The client may disconnect at any time for any reason.

## 2.1, Extended Protocol
Extended protocol is disabled.

## 2.2, API Reference
ARIA FORESIGHT has no standard API requests outside "REQUEST TYPE".

The FORESIGHT client will dispatch user-defined commands under the `interfaces.json` file.
The server must support these user-defined commands to function.

There are two types of accepted user-defined requests, SIGNAL and PAYLOAD.
SIGNAL simply sends a command string to the server with no need for acknowledgement.
PAYLOAD sends a command string to the server, like SIGNAL, but will then expect an acknowledgement ("OK"), afterwards sending the string payload.

### REQUEST
Has children,
- TYPE (Returns name of client application)

Use in format,
REQUEST (CHILD ARGUMENT)
